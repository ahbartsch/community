# Poll: USDC-A Liquidation Ratio Adjustment - September 14, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which presents a number of possible **Liquidation Ratio** options for USDC-A Vault. Voters are now able to signal their support for a **USDC-A Liquidation Ratio** within a range of 110% to 101%.
Stability Fees are calculated from the Base Rate and Risk Premiums using the formula `Stability Fee = max(Base Rate + Risk Premium, 0%)`. **Please note that a negative Base Rate does NOT imply negative Stability Fees**.

This weekly Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, September 14 at 16:00 UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, September 18 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The signal request for reducing the USDC-A Liquidation Ratio can be found [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-we-reduce-the-usdc-a-collateralization-ratio/3886) along with the results. Please review the discussion there to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

On the Friday following the conclusion of the poll, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.

If the Friday executive passes, then this rate change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.
